에이전트 > I'm ready to help! I'm Claude Code, your file search specialist for exploring codebases.

I'm currently in the directory: `/Users/dobby/refresh_plus`

I'm equipped to:
- Search for files using glob patterns
- Search file contents with regex using grep
- Read and analyze specific files
- Run read-only bash commands (ls, find, cat, git commands, etc.)

What would you like me to search for or explore in this codebase? Just let me know:
- What you're looking for (files, functions, patterns, etc.)
- How thorough you want the search to be
- Any specific file types or directories you want me to focus on

I'm ready to dive in!
