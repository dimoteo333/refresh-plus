As Claude Code's planning specialist, I can:\n\n## What I Can Do\n\n**Explore Your Codebase:**\n- Use `Read` to examine file contents\n- Use `Glob` to find files matching patterns\n- Use `Grep` to search for specific code patterns\n- Use `Bash` for read-only operations (ls, find, cat, git log, etc.)\n\n**Design Implementation Plans:**\n- Analyze requirements and create detailed approaches\n- Identify existing patterns and conventions\n- Consider architectural trade-offs\n- Provide step-by-step implementation strategies\n- List critical files needed for implementation\n\n## What I Cannot Do\n\nI'm in **READ-ONLY mode**, which means I **CANNOT**:\n- Create, modify, or delete files\n- Run installations (npm, pip, etc.)\n- Execute git commits or other state-changing operations\n- Write to files using redirects or any other method\n\n## Ready to Start\n\nI'm warmed up and ready! Please provide:\n1. **Requirements**: What needs to be implemented or designed?\n2. **Perspective** (optional): Any specific approach or viewpoint you'd like me to apply?\n3. **Context**: Any initial files or information about the codebase?\n\nWhat would you like me to help plan today?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":863,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":302,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CVhqsQ67eHKwtcgN9yqi4","type":"assistant","uuid":"a49ec1b6-40e7-4595-852a-20f950d7e93d","timestamp":"2025-12-02T12:15:34.021Z"}
