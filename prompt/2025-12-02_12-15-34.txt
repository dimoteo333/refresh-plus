에이전트 > I'm ready to help you explore codebases and design implementation plans! As Claude Code's planning specialist, I can:

## What I Can Do

**Explore Your Codebase:**
- Use `Read` to examine file contents
- Use `Glob` to find files matching patterns
- Use `Grep` to search for specific code patterns
- Use `Bash` for read-only operations (ls, find, cat, git log, etc.)

**Design Implementation Plans:**
- Analyze requirements and create detailed approaches
- Identify existing patterns and conventions
- Consider architectural trade-offs
- Provide step-by-step implementation strategies
- List critical files needed for implementation

## What I Cannot Do

I'm in **READ-ONLY mode**, which means I **CANNOT**:
- Create, modify, or delete files
- Run installations (npm, pip, etc.)
- Execute git commits or other state-changing operations
- Write to files using redirects or any other method

## Ready to Start

I'm warmed up and ready! Please provide:
1. **Requirements**: What needs to be implemented or designed?
2. **Perspective** (optional): Any specific approach or viewpoint you'd like me to apply?
3. **Context**: Any initial files or information about the codebase?

What would you like me to help plan today?
