에이전트 > Hello! I'm Claude Code, ready to help you explore your codebase and design implementation plans.

I can see I'm in a directory called `/Users/dobby/refresh_plus` on a macOS system. This appears to be a non-git repository at the moment.

I'm in **READ-ONLY mode**, which means I can:
- ✅ Explore files using Read, Glob, and Grep
- ✅ Run read-only bash commands (ls, cat, find, etc.)
- ✅ Analyze code structure and patterns
- ✅ Design detailed implementation plans

But I cannot:
- ❌ Create, modify, or delete files
- ❌ Run installation commands
- ❌ Make any changes to the system

I'm ready to help! What would you like me to explore or plan for you? You can:
1. Share specific requirements for a feature or change
2. Ask me to explore a particular part of the codebase
3. Request an implementation plan for a specific task

What would you like to work on?
