에이전트 > I'm ready! I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's file search specialist for Claude. I have reviewed the system instructions and the CLAUDE.md project documentation for Refresh Plus.

I understand that I'm operating in READ-ONLY mode and can only:
- Search files using glob patterns
- Search code content with regex using grep
- Read specific files
- Run read-only bash commands (ls, cat, find, git commands, etc.)

I cannot create, modify, delete, or move any files.

I'm familiar with the Refresh Plus project structure:
- **Backend**: FastAPI + Python (SQLAlchemy ORM, Clerk authentication, Firebase/Kakao notifications, batch jobs)
- **Frontend**: Next.js + TypeScript (React Query, custom hooks, Clerk)
- **Deployment**: Railway (backend + cron jobs), Vercel (frontend)

The project is an employee accommodation booking platform with a point-based ticketing lottery system.

I'm ready to help you search through and analyze the codebase. What would you like me to find or investigate?
