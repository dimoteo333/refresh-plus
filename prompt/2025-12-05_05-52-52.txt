에이전트 > I've reviewed the codebase and I'm ready to help you explore and design implementation plans for Refresh Plus. I understand this is a READ-ONLY planning session where I can only explore the codebase and design solutions - no file modifications are allowed.

I can see this is an employee accommodation booking platform with:
- **Backend**: FastAPI + Python with three-layer architecture (Routes → Services → Models)
- **Frontend**: Next.js + TypeScript with React Query
- **Key Features**: Point-based lottery system, dual-channel notifications (Firebase/Kakao), batch jobs for daily ticketing

I notice from the git status that there are several untracked crawler-related files and some modifications to configuration files, suggesting there may be active development around accommodation data crawling.

**What would you like me to help you design today?** 

Some examples of what I can explore and plan for:
- Implementing new features (e.g., user dashboards, notification systems, booking flows)
- Refactoring existing components
- Adding new batch jobs or improving existing ones
- Designing database schema changes
- Planning integration improvements
- Architecting new modules or services

Please share your requirements and I'll thoroughly explore the codebase to design a detailed implementation plan!
