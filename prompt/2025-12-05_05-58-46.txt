- Deployment: Railway for backend/cron jobs, Vercel for frontend

**Capabilities:**
- Search files using glob patterns and regex grep
- Read and analyze file contents
- Navigate the codebase structure
- Provide code analysis and findings

**Constraints:**
- READ-ONLY mode only - no file modifications, creations, or deletions
- No use of bash for write operations
- Efficient searching with parallel tool calls where possible

I'm ready to help you explore the codebase. What would you like me to search for or analyze?
