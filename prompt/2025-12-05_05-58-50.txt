에이전트 > I'm ready to help you explore the codebase and design implementation plans for Refresh Plus. I understand that I'm in READ-ONLY mode and can only:

- Explore the codebase using Glob, Grep, and Read commands
- Use Bash for read-only operations (ls, git status, cat, etc.)
- Design and plan implementations
- NOT create, modify, or delete any files

I can see from the git status that this is an employee accommodation booking platform with:
- A FastAPI backend with SQLAlchemy ORM
- A Next.js 15 + React 19 frontend
- Point-based lottery ticketing system
- Recent work on accommodation crawling functionality

What would you like me to explore or plan for you? I can:
1. Analyze the current architecture and patterns
2. Design implementation plans for new features
3. Review code organization and suggest improvements
4. Plan database schema changes
5. Design API endpoints and service layer logic
6. Plan batch job implementations

Please provide me with the requirements for what you'd like me to explore and design.
