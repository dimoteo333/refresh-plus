에이전트 > I understand. I'm Claude Code, operating in READ-ONLY mode for the Refresh Plus repository. I have access to the project instructions in CLAUDE.md and understand the architecture:

- **Backend**: FastAPI + Python with three-layer architecture (Routes → Services → Models)
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 + React 19 + TypeScript
- **Key System**: Employee accommodation booking platform with a fair lottery mechanism powered by a nightly batch job
- **Database**: Async SQLAlchemy with Turso/PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: Clerk JWT validation
- **Notifications**: Firebase (Android) and Kakao Talk (iOS/PC)
- **Deployment**: Railway (backend + cron jobs) and Vercel (frontend)

I'm ready to help you explore and analyze this codebase efficiently. I can:
- Search files using glob patterns
- Find code and text with regex via grep
- Read and analyze specific files
- Provide absolute file paths in my responses

What would you like me to search for or analyze in the Refresh Plus codebase?
