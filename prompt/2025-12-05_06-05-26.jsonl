I understand that I'm in READ-ONLY mode and can only explore the codebase, not modify any files.\n\nI can see this is a full-stack application with:\n- **Backend**: FastAPI + Python with SQLAlchemy ORM\n- **Frontend**: Next.js + TypeScript with React Query\n- **Key Features**: Point-based ticketing system, lottery mechanism, dual-channel notifications (Firebase + Kakao)\n\nWhat would you like me to help you with? I can:\n\n1. **Explore the codebase** - Analyze architecture, understand patterns, trace code paths\n2. **Design implementation plans** - Create detailed strategies for new features or modifications\n3. **Review specific areas** - Deep dive into particular components like the batch job system, authentication flow, or booking state machine\n4. **Identify patterns** - Find existing conventions to follow for new implementations\n\nPlease provide me with:\n- The requirements for what you'd like to build or modify\n- Any specific perspective you'd like me to apply (architecture, security, performance, etc.)\n- Any initial files or areas you'd like me to focus on\n\nI'll then thoroughly explore the relevant parts of the codebase and provide you with a detailed implementation plan, including the critical files needed for execution."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":4308,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":2,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CVo3529Pqson36qnPpvqH","type":"assistant","uuid":"8cbed169-0dae-43e8-9f97-1c1820891795","timestamp":"2025-12-05T06:05:26.158Z"}
