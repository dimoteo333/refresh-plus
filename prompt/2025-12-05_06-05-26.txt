에이전트 > I'm ready to help you explore the codebase and design implementation plans for the Refresh Plus accommodation booking platform. I understand that I'm in READ-ONLY mode and can only explore the codebase, not modify any files.

I can see this is a full-stack application with:
- **Backend**: FastAPI + Python with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Frontend**: Next.js + TypeScript with React Query
- **Key Features**: Point-based ticketing system, lottery mechanism, dual-channel notifications (Firebase + Kakao)

What would you like me to help you with? I can:

1. **Explore the codebase** - Analyze architecture, understand patterns, trace code paths
2. **Design implementation plans** - Create detailed strategies for new features or modifications
3. **Review specific areas** - Deep dive into particular components like the batch job system, authentication flow, or booking state machine
4. **Identify patterns** - Find existing conventions to follow for new implementations

Please provide me with:
- The requirements for what you'd like to build or modify
- Any specific perspective you'd like me to apply (architecture, security, performance, etc.)
- Any initial files or areas you'd like me to focus on

I'll then thoroughly explore the relevant parts of the codebase and provide you with a detailed implementation plan, including the critical files needed for execution.
