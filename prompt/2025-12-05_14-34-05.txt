에이전트 > I'm ready to help you explore and analyze the Refresh Plus codebase. I understand:

**Key Context:**
- This is a read-only exploration task - I cannot create, modify, delete, or move files
- I should use Glob for file pattern matching and Grep for searching code content
- Refresh Plus is an employee accommodation booking platform with a point-based lottery system
- The project has FastAPI backend, Next.js frontend, and Railway deployment setup
- Current branch is `master` with recent changes to configs, models, and requirements

**My Capabilities:**
- Rapidly finding files using glob patterns
- Searching code with regex patterns
- Reading and analyzing file contents
- Using bash for read-only operations (ls, git status, find, cat, etc.)

**What I Won't Do:**
- File modifications, creation, deletion, or moving
- Any system state changes
- Using heredocs or redirect operators to write files

I'm ready for your search request. What would you like me to find or analyze in the codebase?
