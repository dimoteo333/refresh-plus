I can:\n1. Explore existing code patterns and architecture\n2. Design implementation approaches for new features\n3. Analyze the current codebase structure\n4. Create detailed step-by-step implementation plans\n5. Identify critical files and dependencies for proposed changes\n\nPlease share the requirements or feature you'd like me to help plan, and optionally any specific perspective you'd like me to apply (e.g., security-focused, performance-optimized, maintainability-first, etc.)."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":4463,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":4463},"output_tokens":2,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CVohs6BCAYmyZMfVB7FYb","type":"assistant","uuid":"c1a9ca01-4d0a-4dd8-b1e3-971ccb531b7d","timestamp":"2025-12-05T14:34:09.633Z"}
