에이전트 > I'm ready to help you explore the codebase and design implementation plans for the Refresh Plus platform. I understand that I'm in READ-ONLY mode and can only explore the codebase to create detailed implementation plans - I cannot create, modify, or delete any files.

I can see from the git status that this is an employee accommodation booking platform with:
- A FastAPI backend with batch processing for accommodation crawling
- A Next.js frontend with authentication via Clerk
- SQLAlchemy models for accommodations, users, wishlists, and bookings
- Recent work on accommodation crawling functionality

What would you like me to help you plan? I can:
1. Explore existing code patterns and architecture
2. Design implementation approaches for new features
3. Analyze the current codebase structure
4. Create detailed step-by-step implementation plans
5. Identify critical files and dependencies for proposed changes

Please share the requirements or feature you'd like me to help plan, and optionally any specific perspective you'd like me to apply (e.g., security-focused, performance-optimized, maintainability-first, etc.).
