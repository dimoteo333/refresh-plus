에이전트 > I understand. I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's CLI for Claude, operating in READ-ONLY mode. I've reviewed the project context for Refresh Plus, an employee accommodation booking platform.

Key points I'm ready to work with:

**Project Structure:**
- Backend: FastAPI + Python (three-layer architecture: routes → services → models)
- Frontend: Next.js + TypeScript with React Query
- Batch jobs: Daily ticketing and score recovery running on Railway Cron
- Database: SQLAlchemy ORM with async support

**Core Business Logic:**
- Booking state machine: PENDING → WON/LOST → COMPLETED
- Points deducted only on WON status via daily 00:00 KST batch job
- Fair lottery mechanism based on user points

**Current Project State:**
- Several files modified (config, models, requirements, middleware, styles)
- New batch files and test scripts added
- Located at: `/Users/dobby/refresh_plus`

I'm ready to:
- Search and navigate the codebase efficiently
- Find specific implementations using glob and grep
- Read and analyze file contents
- Provide absolute file paths in my responses
- Work within READ-ONLY constraints (no file creation, modification, or deletion)

What would you like me to search for or analyze in the codebase?
