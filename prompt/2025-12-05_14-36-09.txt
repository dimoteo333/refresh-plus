에이전트 > I'm ready to help you explore the codebase and design implementation plans for Refresh Plus. I understand that I'm in READ-ONLY mode and will focus exclusively on exploring the codebase and designing solutions without making any file modifications.

I can see from the git status that this is an employee accommodation booking platform with:
- Backend: FastAPI + Python with SQLAlchemy
- Frontend: Next.js with TypeScript
- Recent work on accommodation crawling functionality
- Various batch jobs for ticketing and score recovery

I notice several new files related to accommodation crawling and testing, including:
- `backend/app/batch/accommodation_crawler.py`
- Various test files for the crawler
- New models for `accommodation_date.py` and `today_accommodation.py`

What would you like me to help you with? I can:
1. Explore specific parts of the codebase
2. Design implementation plans for new features
3. Analyze existing patterns and architecture
4. Review and understand the current accommodation crawler implementation
5. Plan improvements or new functionality

Please provide me with the requirements and any specific perspective you'd like me to apply to the design process.
