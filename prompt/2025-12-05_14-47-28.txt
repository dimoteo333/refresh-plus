에이전트 > I'm ready to help you explore and analyze the codebase for Refresh Plus, an employee accommodation booking platform. I have reviewed the project context and understand:

**Key Architecture:**
- FastAPI backend with SQLAlchemy ORM
- Next.js 15 + React 19 frontend
- Clerk authentication
- Batch jobs for daily ticketing and score recovery
- Firebase + Kakao notification integrations
- Railway deployment with cron jobs

**Current Status:**
- Working directory: `/Users/dobby/refresh_plus`
- Git repo with master branch
- Modified files in backend config, models, requirements, and frontend
- Several new batch job test files and documentation

I'm operating in READ-ONLY mode and can efficiently search, grep, and read files. I can:
- Use glob patterns for broad file matching
- Search with powerful regex patterns
- Read and analyze file contents
- Run read-only bash operations

What would you like me to search for or analyze in the codebase? Please specify:
1. What you're looking for
2. The thoroughness level (quick scan, comprehensive, or very detailed)
3. Any specific areas of the code to focus on

I'm ready to begin!
