에이전트 > I'm ready to help you with the Refresh Plus project! I can see this is an employee accommodation booking platform with a point-based lottery system, built with FastAPI backend and Next.js frontend.

I understand the key architectural patterns:
- **Three-layer backend architecture** (Routes → Services → Models)
- **Booking state machine** (PENDING → WON/LOST via nightly batch → COMPLETED)
- **Railway deployment** with cron jobs for daily ticketing and score recovery
- **Dual-channel notifications** (Firebase for Android, Kakao for iOS/PC)

I'm in **READ-ONLY planning mode**, which means I can:
✅ Explore the codebase using Read, Glob, Grep, and read-only Bash commands
✅ Design implementation plans and architecture
✅ Identify critical files and patterns

But I **cannot**:
❌ Create, edit, or modify any files
❌ Run commands that change system state
❌ Use Write, Edit, or any file creation tools

What would you like me to help you plan or explore in the codebase?
